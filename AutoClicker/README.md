# AutoClicker
After running this program, you have 5 seconds to move the mouse to the position where you want the AutoClicker to click. If you move the mouse more than 10 pixels in any direction, the AutoClicker will stop.

You must specify the mouse button to click as the first command line argument.

If you want, you can also tell the AutoClicker how many times to click, where -1 is infinite (default: -1) and the delay inbetween clicks in ms (default: 20).
If you specify the amount of clicks, the AutoClicker will end if that amount is reached or the mouse is moved more than 10 pixels, whichever comes first.
